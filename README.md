# Refactoring Words

Consider the meaning of each sentence.

How can we say each in fewer words?

Refactor each sentence to be more concise, less confusing, or better formatted.

### Example:

```
The cat is purple. The cat is purple and being silly.
```

The purple cat is being silly.

### Exercise:

```
Samus will eventually ride her spaceship from earth to another planet.
```

```
```

```
Link is the hero of Hyrule.
```

```
Zelda is also the hero.
```

```
Gannon is a beast.
```

```
A teenage boy will smoke his first marijuana cigarette, within an hour he will laugh at the  thought of a horse riding a jockey, instead of the other way around.
```

```
Everyone on earth will become flesh-eating zombies. Once the flesh is all gone, they will be dirt-eating zombies.
```
